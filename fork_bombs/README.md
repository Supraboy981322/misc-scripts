I also have a "fork-bomb" written in Zig, but it's not really a fork bomb, because Zig doesn't currently have async, unfortunately. So there is no performance graph for it, as it would take forever to max-out 8GBs of RAM in it's current state. (I might rewrite it when the async Zig update finally comes out to learn the new async)
